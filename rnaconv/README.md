* *rfam_converter*:<br>
	Tool to convert the Rfam database into filetypes and formats that can be used by SISSI.
* *rfam_filter*:<br>
    Filter the converted rfam database by throwing out all alignments (and corresponding consensus structure, frequencies and tree) exceeding a certain length

* *alignment_generator*:<br>
    Tool to generate RNA alignments using SISSI, for given single and doublet equilibrium frequencies, neighbourhood systems and phylogenetic trees, as well as the raw alignments from which the equilibrium frequencies were obtained, in order to re add the contained indels to the generated alignments.
* *alignment_filter*:<br>
	Tool to filter the alignments generated by the alignment_generator by removing sequences that deviate too much from the consensus structure of their alignment. Also contains code to extract the equilibrium frequencies from the generated alignments and form the diffrences between them and the original equilibrium frequencies of the rfam alignments that were used for generation.

* *family_generator*:<br>
	Tool to generate n RNA families of a certain length using SISSI, for given single and doublet equilibrium frequencies and phylogenetic trees.
* *family_filter*:<br>
	Tool to filter the alignments generated by the family_generator by removing sequences that deviate too much from the predicted secondary structure of the ancestral sequence of their alignment.
